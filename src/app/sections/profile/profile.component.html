            <p>Since my earliest childhood, I have always been passionate about the amazing capacities of the human body. Therefore, it is nothing but natural for me to pursue my career in the health sector. Furthermore, by studying to obtain my double degree, I realised that both management and engineering were important to me. This is why I trust that a dream job would be to manage a health-related project involving some very technical aspects such as innovative web technologies or complex mechanical modelling.</p>
